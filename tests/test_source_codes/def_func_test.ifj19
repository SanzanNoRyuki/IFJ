""" Every function has to be defined before its called. """"
""" If the function is called from the main body code, the function has to be firstly defined. """
""" The function does not need to be defined before its called, if we are calling the function """
""" from a different function, which is called after both functions were defined. """

""" TEST 1 - calling undefined function """
f()

""" TEST 2 -  calling function before its defined"""
g()

def g():
	print('Function')

""" TEST 3 - calling function 'i' from function 'h' before it was defined """
# defining function h
def h():
	print('Function 2')
	# calling function i
	i() 

# calling function h
h()

# defining function i, which is defined after the call of function h
def i():
	print('Function 1')

""" TEST 4 - the amount of parameters when calling function != -||- when defining function """

""" TEST 5 - -||- """

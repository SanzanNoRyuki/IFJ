""" There are 2 types of variables: """
""" 1. Local - local variables and parameters can be used only in the function they are defined. """
""" 2. Global - these can be used from the point they are defined till the end of the program. """

""" ERRORS """
""" Function should return 3 if there is a variable, which is not defined - semantic error. """
""" Cant create new variable with the name, which is already taken by function. """
""" Cant create new function with the name, which is already taken by variable. """

""" DEFINITION - a variable is defined as the value is being assigned to it.  """


""" TEST 1 - undefined variable - should return 3 """
if a != 5:
	print('The number is not 5!')

""" TEST 2 - undefined variable in function - should return 3 """ 
def f():  
    print s   

""" TEST 3 - undefined variable - should return 3 """
b = 5
b = c

""" TEST 4 - defining variable with the same name as before defined function """ 
def d():
	s = 'Some text'  
	print s  
   
d = 42.0

""" TEST 5 - defining function with the same name as before defined variable """
e = 42.0

def e():
	s = 'Some text'
	print s

""" TEST 6 - using variable, defined in function - local variable, out of function """

	h = 5

if h != 5:
